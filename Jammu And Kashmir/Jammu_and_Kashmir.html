                    <ul>
                        <li>Kalhana, the first Indian history writer, gave a vivid account of the history of Kashmir before the
                            10th century AD.</li>
                        <li>The greatest Muslim king of early medieval age in Kashmir was Zain-ul-Abidin, who ascended the
                            throne in AD 1420 and ruled up to 1470.</li>
                        <li>His long rule contributed extensively to the spread of art, culture, music, and every other sphere
                            in the life of Kashmir people.</li>
                        <li>He also created a strong army and annexed many regions nearby Kashmir. These were the time of golden
                            rule in Kashmir when peace and harmony prevailed.</li>
                        <li>After the death of King Zain-ul-Abidin, a period of destruction came calling to Kashmir and many
                            raiders from outside looted the state and made the people and local rulers their captive.</li>
                        <li> In 1587, Akbar annexed Kashmir into his vast empire.</li>
                        <li>Jahangir, son of Akbar and next Mughal ruler, visited Kashmir 13 times and created two beautiful
                            gardens on the bank of Dal Lake, namely, the Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh.</li>
                        <li>After two centuries of peace and development, Kashmir came into the hands of the Pathans in 1752,
                            when the Afghan ruler Abdul Shah Abdali attacked this region on the request of local noblemen.</li>
                        <li>In 1819, the Sikhs under Maharaja Ranjit Singh annexed this region, but their empire remained in
                            place only for 27 years.</li>
                        <li>A part of the erstwhile Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu, the region is the subject of a
                            territorial conflict among China, India and Pakistan.</li>
                        <li>The western districts of the former princely state known as Azad Kashmir and the northern
                            territories known as Gilgit-Baltistan have been under Pakistani control since 1947.</li>
                        <li>The Aksai Chin region in the east, bordering Tibet, has been under Chinese control since 1962.</li>
